## Description
This repository **will contain** the source code for our paper [**Contrastive Perplexity for Controlled Generation: An Application in Detoxifying Large Language Models**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08491) to be presented at [ACL2025](https://2025.aclweb.org/).

### Abstract
The generation of toxic content by large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge for the safe deployment of language technology. We propose a novel framework for implicit knowledge editing and controlled text generation by fine-tuning LLMs with a prototype-based contrastive perplexity objective. Central to our method is the construction of hard negativesâ€”toxic outputs that are generated through adversarial paraphrasing to be semantically similar and closely matched in length and model probability to their non-toxic counterparts. By training on these challenging and realistic pairs, our approach ensures robust and stable contrastive optimization. Experimental results in the domain of detoxification demonstrate that our method significantly reduces toxic generation while maintaining strong performance on downstream tasks such as commonsense reasoning and reading comprehension. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging hard negatives for attribute-aware language model fine-tuning.

    abstract = "This paper presents miCSE, a mutual information-based contrastive learning framework that significantly advances the state-of-the-art in few-shot sentence embedding.The proposed approach imposes alignment between the attention pattern of different views during contrastive learning. Learning sentence embeddings with miCSE entails enforcing the structural consistency across augmented views for every sentence, making contrastive self-supervised learning more sample efficient. As a result, the proposed approach shows strong performance in the few-shot learning domain. While it achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks in few-shot learning, it is comparable in the full-shot scenario. This study opens up avenues for efficient self-supervised learning methods that are more robust than current contrastive methods for sentence embedding.",
